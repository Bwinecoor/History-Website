        3. John Brown's Raid on Harpers Ferry/Hanging of John Brown
      </h1>

        <b>
          In 1859 John Brown and a group of people went to Harpers Ferry,
          Virginia to start a raid on a federal armory. Their goal was to start
          an armed revolt of slaves and destroy the institution of slavery.
          Sadly, their attempt failed and John Brown and six of his soldiers
          were tried for treason. Weeks after the raid John Brown was hung. It
          had a big impact because it raised the tension for the presidential
          election in 1860 and when he died, many people were inspired by him
          and his cause to try and get rid of/protest against slavery. His raid
          greatly angered the south because they took it as an attack from the
          North against them. The effects of the raid and his death are a huge
          factor in the cause of the Civil War because it greatly separated the
          South from the North.
